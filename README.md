# CodeEval
My C# solutions to CodeEval's challenges. Check out my profile at http://www.codeeval.com/profile/jjpmcd/

At first I was just trying to game the CodeEval system and attempt to maximise my score for each challenge, but I ended up learning more and more about C# optimization.

I wanted to take a test driven approach using the lovely NCrunch to give me instant feedback on my changes as I looked to refactor.
The unit tests are included within.

Disclaimer: The code within makes a lot of assumptions based on the challenges and would not be advisable in production.
